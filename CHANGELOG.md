### What's new?

* __If you run the executable without arguments (e.g: from the file explorer), you'll be guided on providing
the arguments it needs via prompts.__
* The program now checks for duplicate collections and will ask you if you want to continue if it finds one.
You can also disable this behaviour by passing the `--skip-duplicate-check` flag.
* Backups now include the date in the filename to not overwrite the old ones. 
Be sure to clean up your backups from time to time!
